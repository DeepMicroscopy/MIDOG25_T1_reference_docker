MIDOG 2025 Track 1 Reference Docker Image

Welcome to the MIDOG 2025 reference docker for track 1. This docker image contains a reference implementation of a Fully-Convolutional-One-Stage Object Detection model (FCOS) based on the Torchvision implementation, provided by Jonas Ammeling (Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt, Germany) for the MIDOG 2025 challenge. 

The container shall serve as an example how we (and the grand-challenge plattform) expect the outputs to look like. At the same time, it serves as a template for you to implement your own algorithm for submission to MIDOG 2025. 

For reference, you may also want to read the blog post of grand-challange.org on [how to create an algorithm](https://grand-challenge.org/documentation/create-your-own-algorithm/).


More infos will follow soon!
